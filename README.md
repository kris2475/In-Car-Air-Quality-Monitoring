# AeroGuard: High-Resolution, Geo-Tagged Data Platform

## üåü Introduction: The Polluted Micro-Environment
The air inside a vehicle's cabin often contains pollutant concentrations far exceeding those found outside. Whether due to traffic jams, tunnel transit, or simply driving near industrial areas, this confined space represents a critical micro-environment where real-time exposure can be at its highest.  

However, high-fidelity data correlating these internal air spikes with external factors‚Äîlike location, time, speed, and surrounding weather‚Äîis scarce.  

This is the **"why"** behind **AeroGuard**. It is not designed merely to display current conditions, but to act as a scientific instrument dedicated to robust, mobile data acquisition.  

AeroGuard‚Äôs core mission is to overcome this data gap. Built on the **ESP32 platform**, it is engineered to generate a massive, rich, and multivariate dataset that links precise geographic location (GPS) and time with **24 different environmental, atmospheric, and chemical features**. This complex, multi-sensor data is immediately structured for subsequent processing and analysis, serving as foundational input for **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** initiatives.

## ü§ñ Data for Machine Learning and Deep Learning
The primary output of the AeroGuard system is a vast, correlated dataset, ideal for training advanced ML/DL models aimed at predictive air quality and complex environmental analysis.

### Data Value Proposition
- **Multivariate Feature Set**: Logs 24 distinct, correlated features, providing a granular view of the environment at every point in time.  
- **High-Frequency Temporal Resolution**: 1-second logging captures rapid micro-changes, crucial for time series analysis and dynamic prediction models (e.g., LSTMs).  
- **Geo-Tagged Spatiotemporal Data**: Each datapoint is tagged with GPS coordinates, speed, and heading, enabling models to learn spatial relationships between geography, vehicle dynamics, and pollution concentration.  

### Example Applications
- **Predictive Air Quality Mapping**: Train models to predict pollutant levels (PM2.5, CO) based on location, time, and atmospheric conditions.  
- **Pollutant Source Classification**: Classify pollution sources (e.g., traffic, industrial plumes, wildfires) using PM + gas sensor fusion.  
- **Sensor Fusion & Cross-Calibration**: Correct or calibrate one sensor‚Äôs output based on correlated readings from others.

## üéØ Outcomes of Trained ML/DL Models

### 1. Real-time Predictive Mapping
| Model Application | Description | Data Requirement |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Micro-Environment Forecasting | Predict pollution level (PM2.5, CO) at streets/tunnels before entering. | Geo-Tagged Spatiotemporal Data |
| Sensor Value Estimation | Impute missing sensor values using correlated features. | Multivariate Feature Set |
| Filter Saturation Prediction | Forecast cabin filter replacement needs based on cumulative PM/gas exposure. | Time-Series Analysis |

### 2. Actionable Insights and Behavioral Change (The *"So What"*)
- **Optimal Route Planning**: Navigation recommends *low-exposure* routes, not just fastest ones.  
- **Intelligent Ventilation Control**: Automatically switch between fresh air and recirculation before pollution spikes.  
- **Exposure Attribution**: Attribute exposure to sources (e.g., highway driving vs. garage entry).  

### 3. Policy and Infrastructure Support (The *"Bigger Picture"*)
- **High-Resolution Pollution Maps**: Dynamic, block-by-block maps revealing localized hot spots.  
- **Infrastructure Effectiveness Analysis**: Measure impact of road layouts, green barriers, ventilation systems.  
- **Traffic Management Optimization**: Use pollution correlations to recommend traffic light adjustments.
